  abstract  = {The sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks are envisioned to revolutionize customer services and applications via the Internet of Things (IoT) toward a future of fully intelligent and autonomous systems. In this article, we explore the emerging opportunities brought by 6G technologies in IoT networks and applications, by conducting a holistic survey on the convergence of 6G and IoT. We first shed light on some of the most fundamental 6G technologies that are expected to empower future IoT networks, including edge intelligence, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, space-air-ground-underwater communications, Terahertz communications, massive ultrareliable and low-latency communications, and blockchain. Particularly, compared to the other related survey papers, we provide an in-depth discussion of the roles of 6G in a wide range of prospective IoT applications via five key domains, namely, healthcare IoTs, Vehicular IoTs and Autonomous Driving, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Satellite IoTs, and Industrial IoTs. Finally, we highlight interesting research challenges and point out potential directions to spur further research in this promising area.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, an initial vision of what the sixth generation mobile communication system (6G)might be is presented. This is done through the primary ideas of the 6Genesis Flagship Program (6GFP), a recently formed Finnish academic and industrial consortium aiming at developing key enabling technologies for 6G. 6GFP is an eight-year large-scale research initiative set to ultimately develop, implement and test key enabling technologies for 6G. Motivations, visions, trends and expectations for 6G are first discussed to set the ground for further development. Four main research areas are proposed as the starting point, encompassing not only wireless communications but also computer science, electronics and material science as well as applications and services. The paper provides an in-detail list of technical topics going to be studied in this program, and in general, worth considering for everyone planning to develop beyond 5G technology. The paper also shed some light on how the research will be implemented, showing the logic and relationships between the research areas, discussing already selected promising enabling technology for 6G, as well as envisioning how the proof-of-concept of the developed system will be carried out. An existing state-of-the-art 5G network will be used as the starting point for developing and testing the novel concepts and technologies created in the program.},

   abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) is a very unique platform which is getting very popular day by day. The very reason for this to happen is the advancement in technology and its ability to get linked to everything. This feature of getting linked has in itself provided multiple opportunities and a vast scope of development. The fact that technology in various fields has evolved through the years, is the reason why we observe a rapid change in the shape, size and capacity of various instruments, components and the products used in daily life. And this benefit of simplified technology when accompanied by a platform like IoT eases the work as well as benefits both the manufacturer and the end user. The Internet of Things gives us an opportunity to construct effective administrations, applications for manufacturing, lifesaving solutions, proper cultivation and more. This paper proposes an extensive overview of the IoT technology and its varied applications in life saving, smart cities, agricultural, industrial etc. by reviewing the recent research works and its related technologies. It also accounts the comparison of IoT with M2M, points out some disadvantages of IoT. Furthermore, a detailed exploration of the existing protocols and security issues that would enable such applications is elaborated. Potential future research directions, open areas and challenges faced in the IoT framework are also summarized.},

  abstract  = {While 5G is being deployed and the economy and society begin to reap the associated benefits, the research and development community starts to focus on the next, 6th Generation (6G) of wireless communications. Although there are papers available in the literature on visions, requirements and technical enablers for 6G from various academic perspectives, there is a lack of joint industry and academic work towards 6G. In this paper a consolidated view on vision, values, use cases and key enabling technologies from leading industry stakeholders and academia is presented. The authors represent the mobile communications ecosystem with competences spanning hardware, link layer and networking aspects, as well as standardization and regulation. The second contribution of the paper is revisiting and analyzing the key concurrent initiatives on 6G. A third contribution of the paper is the identification and justification of six key 6G research challenges: (i) 'connecting', in the sense of empowering, exploiting and governing, intelligence; (ii) realizing a network of networks, i.e., leveraging on existing networks and investments, while reinventing roles and protocols where needed; (iii) delivering extreme experiences, when/where needed; (iv) (environmental, economic, social) sustainability to address the major challenges of current societies; (v) trustworthiness as an ingrained fundamental design principle; (vi) supporting cost-effective global service coverage. A fourth contribution is a comprehensive specification of a concrete first-set of industry and academia jointly defined use cases for 6G, e.g., massive twinning, cooperative robots, immersive telepresence, and others. Finally, the anticipated evolutions in the radio, network and management/orchestration domains are discussed.},
